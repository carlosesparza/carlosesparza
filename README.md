- 👋 Hi, I’m @carlosesparza, a 33 y/o telematics engineer living in Concepción, Chile and I'm working as a website developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaining knowledge to make cool stuff and access to better dev gigs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about full stack development, blockchain and the market. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything I fit. Collaboration is my passion (and what keeps my dev gigs coming).
- 📫 You can reach me out here: https://exosfera.cl/contacto/.

This `README.md` file contains public information about my IT work, for collab purposes.
